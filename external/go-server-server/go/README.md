# Go API Server for swagger

This API allows shopping and booking with IATA's New Distribution Capabilities (NDC) standard. It provides aggregated shopping capabilities (AirShopping), detailed offer description (OfferPrice), flight seat selection (SeatAvailability) and booking flight reservations (OrderCreate). Some fields in our API (when noticed) use the PADIS Standard v16.1. Find more information <a href=http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/workgroups/Pages/padis.aspx>here</a>

## Overview
